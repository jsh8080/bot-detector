better explanation than the palpatine return

qui-gon is here so much likeable than in the original movie.

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrsPs3CzHWs&amp;t=163">2:43</a> is

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrsPs3CzHWs&amp;t=6">0:06</a> &quot;Mesa so smarty!&quot;<br><br>&quot;MESA BRAIN SO BIG.&quot;<br><br>&quot;YOUSA POOPOO PEEPEE :/&quot;

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrsPs3CzHWs&amp;t=195">3:15</a> we need 1 hour version

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrsPs3CzHWs&amp;t=166">2:46</a> he was just taking a dump! 😂

She was not an angel, in fact

&quot;shit... may the force be with me... <b>AAAGGHHHH&quot;</b>

99999999999💩💩💩💩👎👎👎👎👎👎👎

now I want to test some death sticks.

I needed this. That Darth Maul scene was too much. 🤣

The whole club scene was magical

Darth maul was done so well 😂😂😂

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrsPs3CzHWs&amp;t=142">02:22</a> <i>May the Force...</i>
<br>  <i>Come Out,</i>
<br><i>...Out of your Dark Side !</i>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrsPs3CzHWs&amp;t=130">2:10</a> funny how the ai even faithfully recreated the crappy makeup. No idea how Lucas let it slide in a Star Wars movie of all things but Industrial Light and Magic must have been only using interns that day, I mean you can clearly see the stuff they used to attach his horns and it looks incredibly dumb and fake.<br><br>When I first noticed this on a closeup screenshot all my memories were shattered.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrsPs3CzHWs&amp;t=10">0:10</a> Qui-Gon briefly turned into David Thewlis.

Is that Trainspotting and Star Wars crossover in the end?

AI has officially gone too far, and I&#39;m laughing my head off.

WERE BACK IN THE 2010S WITH THIS ONE!!!!!

&quot;Its gettin late but I don&#39;t mind&quot;

Fuck that was beautiful man, that acid trip dance sequence was just, I didn&#39;t want it to end, I am so sad Maul didn&#39;t bust some sick moves to take it to the stratosphere

Qui-gon just utterly pulverizing the gungan boss with the force without any ceremony was the funniest shit I&#39;ve seen in weeks.

Youtube Poop now with AI™<br><br>Love it!

Better than the trainwreck of &quot;The Acolyte&quot;. I&#39;ve left this comment so many times now

AI feels like my dreams.

how did you get so many views

man that was funny, why cant people make AI like this, quality memes turned to AI

Well.. That was... Something....

Went through your channel! I love how these went from AI to AI/YTP amazing combination! xD forgot to sub last time I watched some of these!

There’s a bunch of ‘ruined by AI’ channels right now, but this is by far the best. This was epic. 👍

You&#39;d love the Auralnauts version of star wars

You should do john wick next, lol

Pls do twilight saga

Oh god… Jar Jar Binks… No wonder why he’s the most hated

This look like a fever dream 😂

im so happy that AI`s understanding of Humor is what makes me laugh :D

Manolo Lama

Way better than the Disney version :)

Hahahahahaha!

I love this video i hope it blows up. I think the scenarios here are genius i got a really good laugh. I have to ask did you give a certain prompt for the ai to make these scenes or did it make it on its own with the footage you gave it?

God damn the part with Darth Maul in the bathroom got me laughing so hard, it could be legit XD

why is darth maul eating so well done lmao

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrsPs3CzHWs&amp;t=63">1:03</a> the stoner droid squad 😂😂😂😂😂😂

obiwan is getting catfished by booty hole mouth while quigon brought the bumper car to the club and is tearing it up. What a night

I&#39;m taking them to Croissant. Lmao

I appreciate all the effort you put into making extra scenes and new voice lines, but i preferred the simplicity of just having the regular movie playing with a bunch unexpected and random stuff happening.

only 2k views?

These extended AI scenes are phenomenal compared to so many &quot;destroyed by AI&quot; vids only going for 10 second clips

I haven&#39;t laughed this hard in a while, thank you

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrsPs3CzHWs&amp;t=162">2:42</a> Tarantino film ahh death

Darth Maul getting eviscerated on the toilet was glorious.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrsPs3CzHWs&amp;t=241">4:01</a> Now <i>this</i> is pod racing.

That bong saber looool 😂

Lord of the rings, please

You improved the prequels!

make more harry potter AI vids and Lord of the Rings Please! or the hobbit!

here before 1 mio views

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrsPs3CzHWs&amp;t=50">0:50</a> the best I saw in months

Everything up to the dance party is absolutely hilarious. Especially the Darth Maul sequence looks so real. <br>Next up: Obi-Wan consumes tons of Death Sticks!

Qui-Gon Jinn&#39;s ride is just great.

still better writing than the sequels

A good shit is priceless! (Sorry for my English)

как-то скучно получилось.. ничего интересного

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrsPs3CzHWs&amp;t=50">0:50</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrsPs3CzHWs&amp;t=64">1:04</a> is basically the most natural-looking and sounding<br>And wow, that was hilarious.

The title should be how Star Wars Episode I, AI saved it

That hand puppet Yoda is everything!

Seeing a drug-addled Jedi is the reason I pay for the internet

This is exaclty why AI was invented.

Awesome
